# Personalized Music Genre Recommendation Using GMM 🎶

This project uses **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)** to recommend music genres based on user preferences. By analyzing the **Million Song Dataset**, it clusters songs into genres and suggests similar ones based on audio features.

---

## 🚀 Features
✅ Loads song features (tempo, valence, danceability, etc.)  
✅ Trains a GMM to cluster songs into genres  
✅ Personalized recommendations for a user’s Spotify playlist  
✅ Lightweight code – dataset is excluded to keep repo size small

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- **Python** (core code)
- **scikit-learn** (GMM implementation)
- **joblib** (model persistence)
- **Spotify API** (for user playlists)
- **h5py** (reading `.h5` song files – *not included*)

---

## 📁 Dataset
**Dataset:** [Million Song Dataset](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/)  
⚠️ Note: The dataset is not included in this repo due to size (~10GB). Download it separately and place it in the `millionsongsubset/` directory.
